# Dataset
- author_file_ann.txt

Contain an anonymous coauthor network with two integers (range from 0 to 6610, each
represents one unique author) per line (an edge), which means two authors have
cooperated.

- paper_file_ann.txt

Contain an anonymous citation network with two integers (range from 0 to 79936, each
represents one unique paper) per line (an edge), referring that the paper with former id
cites the paper with latter id.

- bipartite_file_ann.txt
  
Contain an anonymous bipartite network with two integers per line (an edge). The first
id refers to an author, and the second id refers to a paper that the author cites.
In this lab, we can view authors as users while papers can be regarded as items.

- feature.pkl

For a better and reasonable experiment setup, we provide initial features with a
dimension size of 512 for each paper, generated by USE (Universal Sentence Encoder),
and need to be read with pickle.load() .
